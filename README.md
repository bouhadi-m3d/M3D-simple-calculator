- **Division (/)** (with zero-division check)
- **Modulo (%)** (with zero-modulo check)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use `g++` which is part of the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bouhadi-m3d/M3D-simple-calculator.git
    cd M3D-simple-calculator
    ```
2. Compile the code:
    ```sh
    g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp
    ```

### Running the Application
To run the compiled application, use the following command:

```sh
./calculator
``` 
## Usage

Follow the prompts to enter two numbers and an operator symbol. The application will display the result of the chosen operation.

## Example

```sh
========================================
